The Examination System is a Java-based application designed to provide an efficient and interactive Graphical User Interface (GUI) for conducting multiple-choice question (MCQ) assessments. It allows users to attempt MCQs, evaluate their responses, and receive instant feedback in the form of a final score.

This system is implemented using Java, leveraging AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) and Swing to ensure a user-friendly and responsive interface.
